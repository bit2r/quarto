Each choice involves uncertainty about which path will \nget you to your destination. Trusting our intuition to make the \nchoice often ends up with us making a suboptimal choice. \nTurning the uncertainty into numbers has proved a potent way of \nanalyzing the paths and finding the shortcut to your destination. \nThe mathematical theory of probability hasn’t eliminated risk, \nbut it allows us to manage that risk more effectively. The strategy \nis to analyze all the possible scenarios that the future holds and \nthen to see what proportion of them lead to success or failure. \nThis gives you a much better map of the future on which to base \nyour decisions about which path to choose.\n* junction: 분기점\n** suboptimal: 차선의\n① 성공적인 삶을 위해 미래에 대한 구체적인 계획을 세워야 한다.\n② 중요한 결정을 내릴 때에는 자신의 직관에 따라 판단해야 한다.\n③ 더 나은 선택을 위해 성공 가능성을 확률적으로 분석해야 한다.\n④ 빠른 목표 달성을 위해 지름길로 가고자 할 때 신중해야 한다. \n⑤ 인생의 여정에서 선택에 따른 결과를 스스로 책임져야 한다.\n  이제 듣기 문제가 끝났습니다. 18번부터는 문제지의 지시에 \n따라 답을 하시기 바랍니다.\n이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다. \n\n\n### 문제 21{.unnumbered}\n21. 밑줄 친 make oneself public to oneself 가 다음 글에서 의미\n하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]\nComing of age in the 18th and 19th centuries, the personal \ndiary became a centerpiece in the construction of a modern \nsubjectivity, at the heart of which is the application of reason \nand critique to the understanding of world and self, which \nallowed the creation of a new kind of knowledge. Diaries were \ncentral media through which enlightened and free subjects \ncould be constructed. They provided a space where one could \nwrite daily about her whereabouts, feelings, and thoughts. \nOver time and with rereading, disparate entries, events, and \nhappenstances could be rendered into insights and narratives \nabout the self, and allowed for the formation of subjectivity. It \nis in that context that the idea of “the self [as] both made and \nexplored with words” emerges. Diaries were personal and \nprivate; one would write for oneself, or, in Habermas’s \nformulation, one would make oneself public to oneself. By \nmaking the self public in a private sphere, the self also became \nan object for self-inspection and self-critique.\n* disparate: 이질적인\n** render: 만들다\n① use writing as a means of reflecting on oneself\n② build one’s identity by reading others’ diaries\n③ exchange feedback in the process of writing\n④ create an alternate ego to present to others\n⑤ develop topics for writing about selfhood \n\n\n### 문제 22{.unnumbered}\n22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?\nUrban delivery vehicles can be adapted to better suit the \ndensity of urban distribution, which often involves smaller \nvehicles such as vans, including bicycles. The latter have the \npotential to become a preferred ‘last-mile’ vehicle, particularly \nin high-density and congested areas. In locations where \nbicycle use is high, such as the Netherlands, delivery bicycles \nare also used to carry personal cargo (e.g. groceries). Due to \ntheir low acquisition and maintenance costs, cargo bicycles \nconvey much potential in developed and developing countries \nalike, such as the becak (a three-wheeled bicycle) in Indonesia. \nServices using electrically assisted delivery tricycles have \nbeen successfully implemented in France and are gradually \nbeing adopted across Europe for services as varied as parcel \nand catering deliveries. Using bicycles as cargo vehicles is \nparticularly encouraged when combined with policies that \nrestrict motor vehicle access to specific areas of a city, such as \ndowntown or commercial districts, or with the extension of \ndedicated bike lanes.\n① 도시에서 자전거는 효율적인 배송 수단으로 사용될 수 있다.\n② 자전거는 출퇴근 시간을 줄이기 위한 대안으로 선호되고 있다.\n③ 자전거는 배송 수단으로의 경제적 장단점을 모두 가질 수 있다.\n④ 수요자의 요구에 부합하는 다양한 용도의 자전거가 개발되고 있다.\n⑤ 세계 각국에서는 전기 자전거 사용을 장려하는 정책을 추진하고 있다. \n\n\n### 문제 23{.unnumbered}\n23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]\nAn important advantage of disclosure, as opposed to more \naggressive forms of regulation, is its flexibility and respect for \nthe operation of free markets. Regulatory mandates are blunt \nswords; they tend to neglect diversity and may have serious \nunintended adverse effects. For example, energy efficiency \nrequirements for appliances may produce goods that work less \nwell or that have characteristics that consumers do not want. \nInformation provision, by contrast, respects freedom of \nchoice. If automobile manufacturers are required to measure \nand publicize the safety characteristics of cars, potential car \npurchasers can trade safety concerns against other attributes, \nsuch as price and styling. If restaurant customers are informed \nof the calories in their meals, those who want to lose weight \ncan make use of the information, leaving those who are \nunconcerned about calories unaffected. Disclosure does not \ninterfere with, and should even promote, the autonomy (and \nquality) of individual decision-making.\n* mandate: 명령\n** adverse: 거스르는\n*** autonomy: 자율성\n① steps to make public information accessible to customers \n② benefits of publicizing information to ensure free choices\n③ strategies for companies to increase profits in a free market\n④ necessities of identifying and analyzing current industry trends\n⑤ effects of diversified markets on reasonable customer choices \n\n\n### 문제 24{.unnumbered}\n24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?\nDifferent parts of the brain’s visual system get information \non a need-to-know basis. Cells that help your hand muscles \nreach out to an object need to know the size and location of \nthe object, but they don’t need to know about color. They need \nto know a little about shape, but not in great detail. Cells that \nhelp you recognize people’s faces need to be extremely \nsensitive to details of shape, but they can pay less attention to \nlocation. It is natural to assume that anyone who sees an object \nsees everything about it ― the shape, color, location, and \nmovement. However, one part of your brain sees its shape, \nanother sees color, another detects location, and another \nperceives movement. Consequently, after localized brain \ndamage, it is possible to see certain aspects of an object and \nnot others. Centuries ago, people found it difficult to imagine \nhow someone could see an object without seeing what color it \nis. Even today, you might find it surprising to learn about \npeople who see an object without seeing where it is, or see it \nwithout seeing whether it is moving.\n① Visual Systems Never Betray Our Trust!\n② Secret Missions of Color-Sensitive Brain Cells\n③ Blind Spots: What Is Still Unknown About the Brain\n④ Why Brain Cells Exemplify Nature’s Recovery Process\n⑤ Separate and Independent: Brain Cells’ Visual Perceptions\n이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다. \n\n\n### 문제 25{.unnumbered}\n25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?\nThe above graph shows the percentages of Americans’ \npreferred type of place to live by age group, based on a 2020 \nsurvey. ① In each of the three age groups, Town/Rural Area \nwas the most preferred type of place to live. ② In the 18-34 \nyear-olds group, the percentage of those who preferred \nBig/Small City was higher than that of those who preferred \nSuburb of Big/Small City. ③ In the 35-54 year-olds group, the \npercentage of those who preferred Suburb of Big/Small City \nexceeded that of those who preferred Big/Small City. ④ In the \n55 year-olds and older group, the percentage of those who chose \nBig/Small City among the three preferred types of place to live \nwas the lowest. ⑤ Each percentage of the three preferred types \nof place to live was higher than 20% across the three age \ngroups. \n\n\n### 문제 26{.unnumbered}\n26. Niklas Luhmann에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 \n것은?\nNiklas Luhmann, a renowned sociologist of the twentieth \ncentury, was born in Lüneburg, Germany in 1927. After World \nWar II, he studied law at the University of Freiburg until 1949. \nEarly in his career, he worked for the State of Lower Saxony, \nwhere he was in charge of educational reform. In 1960—1961, \nLuhmann had the chance to study sociology at Harvard \nUniversity, where he was influenced by Talcott Parsons, one \nof the most famous social system theorists. Later, Luhmann \ndeveloped his own social system theory. In 1968, he became a \nprofessor of sociology at the University of Bielefeld.

To \nunderstand how trends can ultimately give individuals power \nand freedom, one must first discuss fashion’s importance as a \nbasis for change. The most common explanation offered by \nmy informants as to why fashion is so appealing is ① that it \nconstitutes a kind of theatrical costumery. Clothes are part of \nhow people present ② them to the world, and fashion locates \nthem in the present, relative to what is happening in society \nand to fashion’s own history. As a form of expression, fashion \ncontains a host of ambiguities, enabling individuals to recreate \nthe meanings ③ associated with specific pieces of clothing. \nFashion is among the simplest and cheapest methods of \nself-expression: clothes can be ④ inexpensively purchased \nwhile making it easy to convey notions of wealth, intellectual \nstature, relaxation or environmental consciousness, even if \nnone of these is true.

When the Industrial Revolution arrived \nwith its great innovation, the motor, we didn’t leave our world \nto go to some ① remote motorspace! On the contrary, we \nbrought the motors into our lives, as automobiles, refrigerators, \ndrill presses, and pencil sharpeners. This ② absorption has \nbeen so complete that we refer to all these tools with names that \ndeclare their usage, not their “motorness.” These innovations \nled to a major socioeconomic movement precisely because they \nentered and ③ affected profoundly our everyday lives.

There is something deeply paradoxical about the professional \nstatus of sports journalism, especially in the medium of print. \nIn discharging their usual responsibilities of description and \ncommentary, reporters’ accounts of sports events are eagerly \nconsulted by sports fans, while in their broader journalistic \nrole of covering sport in its many forms, sports journalists are \namong the most visible of all contemporary writers. The \nruminations of the elite class of ‘celebrity’ sports journalists \nare much sought after by the major newspapers, their lucrative \ncontracts being the envy of colleagues in other ‘disciplines’ of \njournalism. Yet sports journalists do not have a standing in \ntheir profession that corresponds to the size of their readerships \nor of their pay packets, with the old saying (now reaching the \nstatus of cliché) that sport is the ‘toy department of the news \nmedia’ still readily to hand as a dismissal of the worth of what \nsports journalists do.

People have always wanted to be around other people and \nto learn from them. Cities have long been dynamos of social \npossibility, foundries of art, music, and fashion. Slang, or, if you \nprefer, “lexical innovation,” has always started in cities ― an \noutgrowth of all those different people so frequently exposed to \none another. It spreads outward, in a manner not unlike trans-\nmissible disease, which itself typically “takes off” in cities. If, as \nthe noted linguist Leonard Bloomfield argued, the way a person \ntalks is a “composite result of what he has heard before,” then \nlanguage innovation would happen where the most people heard \nand talked to the most other people. Cities drive taste change \nbecause they \n, \nwho not surprisingly are often the creative people cities seem \nto attract.

The entrance to a honeybee colony, often referred to as \nthe dancefloor, is a market place for information about the \nstate of the colony and the environment outside the hive. \nStudying interactions on the dancefloor provides us with a \nnumber of illustrative examples of how individuals \nchanging their own behavior in response to local information \n. For\nexample, upon returning to their hive honeybees that have \ncollected water search out a receiver bee to unload their water \nto within the hive. If this search time is short then the returning \nbee is more likely to perform a waggle dance to recruit others \nto the water source. Conversely, if this search time is long then \nthe bee is more likely to give up collecting water. Since \nreceiver bees will only accept water if they require it, either for \nthemselves or to pass on to other bees and brood, this unloading \ntime is correlated with the colony’s overall need of water. Thus \nthe individual water forager’s response to unloading time (up or \ndown) regulates water collection in response to the colony’s \nneed.

We understand that the segregation of our consciousness \ninto present, past, and future is both a fiction and an oddly \nself-referential framework; your present was part of your \nmother’s future, and your children’s past will be in part your \npresent. Nothing is generally wrong with structuring our \nconsciousness of time in this conventional manner, and it often \nworks well enough. In the case of climate change, however, \nthe sharp division of time into past, present, and future has \nbeen desperately misleading and has, most importantly, \nhidden from view the extent of the responsibility of those of \nus alive now. The narrowing of our consciousness of time \nsmooths the way to divorcing ourselves from responsibility \nfor developments in the past and the future with which our lives \nare in fact deeply intertwined. In the climate case, it is not that \n. It is \nthat the realities are obscured from view by the partitioning of \ntime, and so questions of responsibility toward the past and \nfuture do not arise naturally.

Learning \nto control your voice and use it for different purposes is, \ntherefore, one of the most important skills to develop as an early \ncareer teacher. ① The more confidently you give instructions, \nthe higher the chance of a positive class response. ② There are \ntimes when being able to project your voice loudly will be very \nuseful when working in school, and knowing that you can cut \nthrough a noisy classroom, dinner hall or playground is a great \nskill to have. ③ In order to address serious noise issues in \nschool, students, parents and teachers should search for a \nsolution together. ④ However, I would always advise that you \nuse your loudest voice incredibly sparingly and avoid shouting \nas much as possible. ⑤ A quiet, authoritative and measured \ntone has so much more impact than slightly panicked shouting.\n[36～37] 주어진 글 다음에 이어질 글의 순서로 가장 적절한 \n것을 고르시오. \n\n\n### 문제 36{.unnumbered}\n36.\nA fascinating species of water flea exhibits a kind of \nflexibility that evolutionary biologists call adaptive plasticity.\n(A) That’s a clever trick, because producing spines and a \nhelmet is costly, in terms of energy, and conserving \nenergy is essential for an organism’s ability to survive and \nreproduce. The water flea only expends the energy needed \nto produce spines and a helmet when it needs to.\n(B) If the baby water flea is developing into an adult in water \nthat includes the chemical signatures of creatures that \nprey on water fleas, it develops a helmet and spines to \ndefend itself against predators. If the water around it \ndoesn’t include the chemical signatures of predators, the \nwater flea doesn’t develop these protective devices.\n(C) So it may well be that this plasticity is an adaptation: a \ntrait that came to exist in a species because it contributed \nto reproductive fitness. There are many cases, across \nmany species, of adaptive plasticity.

From the client’s point of view, the pricing \nmakes sense in part because most clients in these cases are \nunfamiliar with and possibly intimidated by law firms. \nTheir biggest fears are high fees for a case that may take \nyears to settle.\n(B) By using contingency pricing, clients are ensured that they \npay no fees until they receive a settlement. In these and \nother instances of contingency pricing, the economic value \nof the service is hard to determine before the service, and \nproviders develop a price that allows them to share the \nrisks and rewards of delivering value to the buyer.\n(C) Contingency pricing is the major way that personal injury \nand certain consumer cases are billed.

Once parks are in place, they are no inert stage ―\ntheir purposes and meanings are made and remade by planners \nand by park users. Moments of park creation are particularly \ntelling, however, for they reveal and actualize ideas about \nnature and its relationship to urban society. ( ① ) Indeed, what \ndistinguishes a park from the broader category of public space \nis the representation of nature that parks are meant to embody.\n( ② ) Public spaces include parks, concrete plazas, sidewalks, \neven indoor atriums. ( ③ ) Parks typically have trees, grass, \nand other plants as their central features. ( ④ ) When entering \na city park, people often imagine a sharp separation from \nstreets, cars, and buildings. ( ⑤ ) What’s behind this idea is \nnot only landscape architects’ desire to design aesthetically \nsuggestive park spaces, but a much longer history of Western \nthought that envisions cities and nature as antithetical spaces \nand oppositional forces.\n* aesthetically: 미적으로\n** antithetical: 대조적인 \n\n\n### 문제 39{.unnumbered}\n39.  \nIt may be easier to reach an agreement when settlement \nterms don’t have to be implemented until months in the future.\nNegotiators should try to find ways to slice a large issue into \nsmaller pieces, known as using salami tactics. ( ① ) Issues \nthat can be expressed in quantitative, measurable units are easy \nto slice. ( ② ) For example, compensation demands can be \ndivided into cents-per-hour increments or lease rates can be \nquoted as dollars per square foot. ( ③ ) When working to \nfractionate issues of principle or precedent, parties may use the \ntime horizon (when the principle goes into effect or how long it \nwill last) as a way to fractionate the issue. ( ④ ) Another \napproach is to vary the number of ways that the principle may \nbe applied. ( ⑤ ) For example, a company may devise a \nfamily emergency leave plan that allows employees the \nopportunity to be away from the company for a period of no \nlonger than three hours, and no more than once a month, for \nillness in the employee’s immediate family.

Social \nand economic conditions, however, often stand in the way \nof the craftsman’s discipline and commitment: schools may \nfail to provide the tools to do good work, and workplaces \nmay not truly value the aspiration for quality. And though \ncraftsmanship can reward an individual with a sense of \npride in work, this reward is not simple. The craftsman \noften faces conflicting objective standards of excellence; \nthe desire to do something well for its own sake can be \nweakened by competitive pressure, by frustration, or by \nobsession.\n* swath: 구획\n󰀻\nCraftsmanship, a human desire that has\n(A)\nover \ntime in diverse contexts, often encounters factors that \n(B)\nits full development.\n(A)\n(B)\n(A)\n(B)\n① persisted\n…limit\n② persisted\n…cultivate\n③ evolved\n…accelerate\n④ diminished …shape\n⑤ diminished …restrict\n이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다. \n\n\n### 문제 41{.unnumbered}\n41. 윗글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?\n① The Power of Simple Formulas in Decision Making\n② Always Prioritise: Tips for Managing Big Data\n③ Algorithms’ Mistakes: The Myth of Simplicity\n④ Be Prepared!

Diaries were \ncentral media through which enlightened and free subjects \ncould be constructed. They provided a space where one could \nwrite daily about her whereabouts, feelings, and thoughts. \nOver time and with rereading, disparate entries, events, and \nhappenstances could be rendered into insights and narratives \nabout the self, and allowed for the formation of subjectivity. It \nis in that context that the idea of “the self [as] both made and \nexplored with words” emerges. Diaries were personal and \nprivate; one would write for oneself, or, in Habermas’s \nformulation, one would make oneself public to oneself.

There is something deeply paradoxical about the professional \nstatus of sports journalism, especially in the medium of print. \nIn discharging their usual responsibilities of description and \ncommentary, reporters’ accounts of sports events are eagerly \nconsulted by sports fans, while in their broader journalistic \nrole of covering sport in its many forms, sports journalists are \namong the most visible of all contemporary writers. The \nruminations of the elite class of ‘celebrity’ sports journalists \nare much sought after by the major newspapers, their lucrative \ncontracts being the envy of colleagues in other ‘disciplines’ of \njournalism. Yet sports journalists do not have a standing in \ntheir profession that corresponds to the size of their readerships \nor of their pay packets, with the old saying (now reaching the \nstatus of cliché) that sport is the ‘toy department of the news \nmedia’ still readily to hand as a dismissal of the worth of what \nsports journalists do. This reluctance to take sports journalism \nseriously produces the paradoxical outcome that sports \nnewspaper writers are much read but little\n.\n* discharge: 이행하다\n** rumination: 생각\n*** lucrative: 돈을 많이 버는\n① admired\n② paid\n③ discussed\n④ censored\n⑤ challenged \n\n\n### 문제 32{.unnumbered}\n32. People have always wanted to be around other people and \nto learn from them. Cities have long been dynamos of social \npossibility, foundries of art, music, and fashion. Slang, or, if you \nprefer, “lexical innovation,” has always started in cities ― an \noutgrowth of all those different people so frequently exposed to \none another. It spreads outward, in a manner not unlike trans-\nmissible disease, which itself typically “takes off” in cities. If, as \nthe noted linguist Leonard Bloomfield argued, the way a person \ntalks is a “composite result of what he has heard before,” then \nlanguage innovation would happen where the most people heard \nand talked to the most other people.

The entrance to a honeybee colony, often referred to as \nthe dancefloor, is a market place for information about the \nstate of the colony and the environment outside the hive. \nStudying interactions on the dancefloor provides us with a \nnumber of illustrative examples of how individuals \nchanging their own behavior in response to local information \n. For\nexample, upon returning to their hive honeybees that have \ncollected water search out a receiver bee to unload their water \nto within the hive. If this search time is short then the returning \nbee is more likely to perform a waggle dance to recruit others \nto the water source. Conversely, if this search time is long then \nthe bee is more likely to give up collecting water. Since \nreceiver bees will only accept water if they require it, either for \nthemselves or to pass on to other bees and brood, this unloading \ntime is correlated with the colony’s overall need of water. Thus \nthe individual water forager’s response to unloading time (up or \ndown) regulates water collection in response to the colony’s \nneed.

We understand that the segregation of our consciousness \ninto present, past, and future is both a fiction and an oddly \nself-referential framework; your present was part of your \nmother’s future, and your children’s past will be in part your \npresent. Nothing is generally wrong with structuring our \nconsciousness of time in this conventional manner, and it often \nworks well enough. In the case of climate change, however, \nthe sharp division of time into past, present, and future has \nbeen desperately misleading and has, most importantly, \nhidden from view the extent of the responsibility of those of \nus alive now. The narrowing of our consciousness of time \nsmooths the way to divorcing ourselves from responsibility \nfor developments in the past and the future with which our lives \nare in fact deeply intertwined. In the climate case, it is not that \n. It is \nthat the realities are obscured from view by the partitioning of \ntime, and so questions of responsibility toward the past and \nfuture do not arise naturally.

The water flea only expends the energy needed \nto produce spines and a helmet when it needs to.\n(B) If the baby water flea is developing into an adult in water \nthat includes the chemical signatures of creatures that \nprey on water fleas, it develops a helmet and spines to \ndefend itself against predators. If the water around it \ndoesn’t include the chemical signatures of predators, the \nwater flea doesn’t develop these protective devices.\n(C) So it may well be that this plasticity is an adaptation: a \ntrait that came to exist in a species because it contributed \nto reproductive fitness. There are many cases, across \nmany species, of adaptive plasticity. Plasticity is conducive \nto fitness if there is sufficient variation in the environment.\n* spine: 가시 돌기\n** conducive: 도움되는\n① (A) － (C) － (B)\n② (B) － (A) － (C)\n③ (B) － (C) － (A)\n④ (C) － (A) － (B)\n⑤ (C) － (B) － (A)\n이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다. \n\n\n### 문제 37{.unnumbered}\n37.\nThe most commonly known form of results-based pricing \nis a practice called contingency pricing, used by lawyers.\n(A) Therefore, only an outcome in the client’s favor is \ncompensated. From the client’s point of view, the pricing \nmakes sense in part because most clients in these cases are \nunfamiliar with and possibly intimidated by law firms. \nTheir biggest fears are high fees for a case that may take \nyears to settle.\n(B) By using contingency pricing, clients are ensured that they \npay no fees until they receive a settlement. In these and \nother instances of contingency pricing, the economic value \nof the service is hard to determine before the service, and \nproviders develop a price that allows them to share the \nrisks and rewards of delivering value to the buyer.\n(C) Contingency pricing is the major way that personal injury \nand certain consumer cases are billed.

Once parks are in place, they are no inert stage ―\ntheir purposes and meanings are made and remade by planners \nand by park users. Moments of park creation are particularly \ntelling, however, for they reveal and actualize ideas about \nnature and its relationship to urban society. ( ① ) Indeed, what \ndistinguishes a park from the broader category of public space \nis the representation of nature that parks are meant to embody.\n( ② ) Public spaces include parks, concrete plazas, sidewalks, \neven indoor atriums. ( ③ ) Parks typically have trees, grass, \nand other plants as their central features. ( ④ ) When entering \na city park, people often imagine a sharp separation from \nstreets, cars, and buildings. ( ⑤ ) What’s behind this idea is \nnot only landscape architects’ desire to design aesthetically \nsuggestive park spaces, but a much longer history of Western \nthought that envisions cities and nature as antithetical spaces \nand oppositional forces.\n* aesthetically: 미적으로\n** antithetical: 대조적인 \n\n\n### 문제 39{.unnumbered}\n39.  \nIt may be easier to reach an agreement when settlement \nterms don’t have to be implemented until months in the future.\nNegotiators should try to find ways to slice a large issue into \nsmaller pieces, known as using salami tactics. ( ① ) Issues \nthat can be expressed in quantitative, measurable units are easy \nto slice. ( ② ) For example, compensation demands can be \ndivided into cents-per-hour increments or lease rates can be \nquoted as dollars per square foot. ( ③ ) When working to \nfractionate issues of principle or precedent, parties may use the \ntime horizon (when the principle goes into effect or how long it \nwill last) as a way to fractionate the issue. ( ④ ) Another \napproach is to vary the number of ways that the principle may \nbe applied. ( ⑤ ) For example, a company may devise a \nfamily emergency leave plan that allows employees the \nopportunity to be away from the company for a period of no \nlonger than three hours, and no more than once a month, for \nillness in the employee’s immediate family.

Craftsmanship \ncuts a far wider swath than skilled manual labor; it serves \nthe computer programmer, the doctor, and the artist; \nparenting improves when it is practiced as a skilled craft, \nas does citizenship. In all these domains, craftsmanship \nfocuses on objective standards, on the thing in itself. Social \nand economic conditions, however, often stand in the way \nof the craftsman’s discipline and commitment: schools may \nfail to provide the tools to do good work, and workplaces \nmay not truly value the aspiration for quality. And though \ncraftsmanship can reward an individual with a sense of \npride in work, this reward is not simple.
